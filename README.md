🤩 I have many hobbies and interests. Previosly I believed that was so bad, cause I needed focus in a one thing in the life. But it's a big lie. I like:
- 🎨 Oleo paint
- 🎸 play the guitar
- 📖 read about univeral history
- 🖼️ take portrait photography
- 🧑‍💻 try new technologies
- 🕺💃 dance latin music (in couple)
- 😅 etc, etc, etc

🚀 I have not a specific mentor, but I think there are many people who have succeeded in contributing good things to the world, Elon Musk is one them. He's a visionary, has futuristic ideas, is building the future. It's so great entrepreneur. I admire him.
